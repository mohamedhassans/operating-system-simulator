# Operating System Simulator

## Overview

This is a Java-based simulator designed to replicate the functionality of a simple operating system. It provides several key features for understanding and experimenting with operating system concepts.

## Key Features

### Round Robin Scheduling

The simulator implements a round robin scheduling algorithm, allowing you to configure the quantum size for task scheduling.

### Memory Simulation

It provides simulation for both physical and logical memory, and you can easily adjust the memory sizes as needed for your experiments.

### Virtual Memory

The simulator replicates the process of swapping processes to the hard disk, effectively providing an environment with virtually unlimited memory.

### Mutex Support

To facilitate efficient memory management, the simulator supports mutexes for memory, making it suitable for tasks involving input, output, file operations, and reading/writing.
